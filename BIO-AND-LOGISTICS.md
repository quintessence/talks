# Bio and Logistics

Hello and thank you for taking time to read through my supplemental
information! I am excited to speak (or stream!) at your event, as
teaching and sharing knowledge has always been a passion of mine.

## About my interests, briefly

My focus right now is on helping both people and the Foundations
in the ecosystem create sustainable communities. As open source
has thrived, sometimes we forget why we come to open source: for
joy. This means we must make other choices that help us nurture
that joy, including healthy relationships with ourselves, our
projects, and our ecosystems.

Protecting our joy also comes with other benefits. Coming together
to build processes that allow us to integrate conflict and have a
healthy relationship with it not only helps us be better together,
but also protects us from common social engineering tactics.
Training ourselves and our communities to not inadvertantly
support hero culture as an emergent property, but instead
celebrate the saves that didn't need to happen also means that
larger, more resilient ecosystems of maintainers are less
suseptible to the tactics used in situations like XZUtils and
others.

## Short bio

Quintessence (she/her) has a background in conflict de-escalation, mediation,
and community governance. After a circuitous path in technology, she is now
focusing on making safety the sustainable state: building processes that center
the humanity in our open source communities that both prevents harm proactively
rather than exclusively reacting to it as well as creating space for people to
fully express themselves and their experiences. This work has
led her to founding the [Nivenly Foundation](https://nivenly.org) and
running the [Hachyderm Mastodon instance](https://hachyderm.io/about).

As Executive Director of the Nivenly Foundation, she provides strategic
direction for an organization that centers trans and underrepresented
technologists through democratic governance. In addition to providing
the legal and governance frameworks that we've come to expect from open
source foundations, Nivenly focuses on facilitating contributors' entry
into tech via their open source contributions, by providing community support
and independence.

As Head of the Hachyderm instance, she sets moderation philosophy and leads
the teams who are stewarding a safe space for trans technologists and their
allies. This means prioritizing quality over growth, developing 
moderation practices, and building a culture where self-care and connection
are complementary and protective. Healthy boundaries and emotional wellbeing
make communities more resilient. Collective action requires caring people 
caring for themselves and being able to listen and respond to the needs of
each other.

# What I need from events I speak at

### Code of Conduct

All events that I speak at need to have a Code of Conduct present
with a contact or process that is accessible to attendees.

### Recordings

My talks can be recorded, just please let me know. There are
slight differences in the presentations to accommodate the
difference between "open internet" or "closed room" participation
styles.
