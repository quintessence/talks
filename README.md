# Current Speaking Portfolio

This is a public facing view of the top 2-3 talks that I am either actively
giving, or interested in giving, at any time. Previous talks are also available.

Information included for each talk is: abstract, description, and if there are
companion materials (but not the materials themselves).

* [How to keep Open Source open without leaving our communities open to threats](oss-communities/)
* [A Primer on Propaganda: Do you actually recognize propaganda or are you just not a racist?](propaganda/)
