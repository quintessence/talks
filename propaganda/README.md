## Abstract

Many people feel they are able to avoid being taken in by propaganda. In many cases, this is fueled by the belief that propaganda targets "bad" or "stupid" beliefs: relevantly, propaganda that tries to sell us on a better world on the suffering of others, usually othering people due to the color of their skin, country of origin, orientation or gender. Those who do not share those beliefs frequently believe that they are therefore immune to propaganda, missing completely what it might look like if propaganda was targeting their beliefs instead of the beliefs of others.

Let's learn about what propaganda actually is, how it looks, and how it can target a variety of people and their beliefs.

## Description

"**Propaganda** is communication that is primarily used to influence or persuade an audience to further an agenda, which may not be objective and may be selectively presenting facts to encourage a particular synthesis or perception, or using loaded language to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information that is being presented." (Wikipedia EN)

Propaganda need not be false. In fact, it frequently isn't. Not entirely.

Propaganda need not be amoral. Propaganda is about outcomes. There is nothing stopping it from aligning with any specific moral framework. Even yours. Even mine.

To help us understand and navigate the state of (some) modern propaganda, I will:

* Start with its definition.
* Briefly explain the implications of this definition.
* Present the effects of misattributing other properties to it.
* Focus primarily on the context of social media and, if there is time, OSS.
* Some ways we truly can start to genuinely shield ourselves and others.

**What "other properties, and their consequences"?**

What other properties? Many of us overestimate our ability to be truly immune to propaganda, as there are many common misconceptions around only being vulnerable if you are "bad" (have a ethically corrupt moral compass) or "stupid" (falling for simple, flawed, arguments). Because most of us, regardless of our beliefs, consider ourselves "good" and "smart", we therefore believe that 1 ) we are immune and 2 ) that others are inherently flawed, for falling victim to it. This causes no end of strife, with all participants in various flame wars believing they are on the side of the right and the clever.

**How can we protect ourselves and those we love?**

"Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare" -- Audre Lorde, Black American civil rights activist c 1988.

The urgency of a crisis, of panic, snatches our focus away from us if we are not careful. In our duress, we don't notice things. We don't notice things that social engineering attacks, like propaganda, try to take advantage of and weaponize. Let's take a look at some specific mental health strategies and how, in addition to their other benefits, they can truly help us shield ourselves from propaganda and its tactics.
